# Shuffle_python
A simple program that will combine all possible variations of the elements. There are two functions: the first (shuffle_all) outputs the result at once, the second (shuffle_yield) uses iteration, that is, it outputs the results one by one until the very end. If you do not have the most powerful computer and use the second one for a lot of time.
